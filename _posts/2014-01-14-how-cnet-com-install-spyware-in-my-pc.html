<p>CNET Is one of the worst service ever. Today when I installed the software through it because that software is not available anywhere on internet. I installed it. </p>

<p>After the installer open I run it there is no option that tell me that it install it anything on my PC. Maybe this design very cheaply to enter a spyware in someone’s computer. </p>

<p>It’s install 2 spyware. First it’s download the EXE (which is correct as it should) then I close it. This is not closed. He still downloading the 2 spyware in my PC. </p>

<p>Then suddenly my Chrome crash. I amazed because I rarely got any crash. I never doing any experiments so what happen. Now After restart the chrome I restart the chrome. I am 100% sure something going wrong in my PC. I check the extensions in Chrome, Now It’s have a extension that I never have installed in my chrome.</p>

<p>Suddenly another crash happen. Because 2nd crash I disabled that extension now I got another extension in my Chrome. I really don’t want these 2 extension without any reason. Now I disable it too. I finally check my Task manager and delete that exe (which cnet used to install something on my PC).</p>

<p>Remember that CNET installing the CRAP spyware in your PC for Freeware which is freely available to user.</p>

<p>The same thing also happen with my one of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" title="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</a> project. A site on internet make installer of my repository and distribute it on their own site. after run that kind of setup it’s install the spyware.</p>

<p>Beware of site like this. CNET and many other install the spyware and that’s how they work. </p>

<p>Thanks for read my post <img src="/2014_01_14_how_cnet.com_install_spyware_Image1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
