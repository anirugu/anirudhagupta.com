<p>I am writing my last post <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/anirugu/archive/2011/09/26/firefox-7-released.aspx">Firefox 7 Released</a> when Mozilla release Firefox 7 now they have 9 soon they have 12. Now I am show you a little problem with word processor we use daily. let’s take a look at issue</p>

<p>Suppose my name is Anirudha. what happen if I use some different different software.</p>

<p><em>*Windows Live Writer:- *</em>window live writer have no suggestion about it show <font color="#ff0000">RED</font> border in bottom of text.</p>

<p><em>*Microsoft Word 2007 :- *</em>Maybe it’s a little bit better because when I type anirudha they make it capitalize and show me Anirudha after a correction.</p>

<p><em>*Firefox Nightly :- *</em>When I write anirudha in a textbox I found a correction “Ludhiana”. What is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludhiana">Ludhiana</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Chrome:-</strong> In chrome Web browser when I type anirudha I got some great correction who really not correct. See a list of thing I see for correction</p>

<ol>
<li><div align="justify">Aniakchak </div>   </li>
<li><div align="justify">antivirus </div>   </li>
<li><div align="justify">animated </div>   </li>
<li><div align="justify">aniseed </div>     </li>
</ol>

<p>in HTML5 by default if spellcheck attribute not defined or not have a false value browser try to check their value. The check-spell algorithm designed for checking spelling unable to improve productivity when a user have some non-English words.</p>

<p>Thanks </p>
