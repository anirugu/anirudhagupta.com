<p>From last few month I goo too much spam mail from IBM. one day I check my spam and I have 42 mail from their IBM site. I thing there is fault in their system so that is how I got 42 mails.</p>

<p>I have told the person about this spam mail. The person from IBM told me to mail another guys about this. When I have told them this issue They told me that they have delete my account and this will no further happen in my mail.</p>

<p>itâ€™s going stop for some days but now I got these spam again and again. Somebody help me to know how I can stop it on my Gmail.</p>

<p>Here is a example of the spam.</p>
