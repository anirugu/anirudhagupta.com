<p>Recently I confirmed on channel9 about MVC support in Visual studio 2013.</p>

<ul>
<li>ASP.NET MVC 5 requires ASP.NET 4. </li>
<li>VS2013 has MVC4 and MVC5 </li>
<li>VS2012 has MVC3 and MVC4 </li>
<li>VS2010 has MVC2 and MVC3  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks <a href="http://hanselman.com/blog">Scott</a> to share this information. You can read further detail as comment here <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/9-002">http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/9-002</a></p>
