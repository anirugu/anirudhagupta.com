<p>Few days ago I hear about Succinctly series that syncfusion made for us. You can check all these resources at <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal">http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal</a> The good thing about these books are they are freely available &amp; it’s nicely written for beginners. </p>

<p>For example if you look at <a href="http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/javascript">http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/javascript</a> “JavaScript Succinctly” then you found that their is all code is nicely written for anyone to easily understand. “JavaScript Succinctly” is only 143 pages book so this not make you bore once you start reading the book.</p>
