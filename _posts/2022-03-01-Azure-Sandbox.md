In this post we will learn how we can sandbox to practice azure. For example, if you want to practice Redis, What you need is just type 'Redis exercise site:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/' in Google

Follow the link and go to excercise and you can activate sandbox and this way you can use 10 sandbox per day to practice azure.
