<p>From a long time There is a theme for Firefox that is called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/macosx-theme-firefox-4/?src=api">MacOSX Theme</a> This is used for make Firefox appearance like Mac. The bad news about this add-ons is that this plugin doesn’t maintain as good as it should be. Now this add-ons theme doesn’t work current Firefox.</p>

<p>Don’t worry. You can got it <a href="http://f1beta.com/macosx_theme_firefox_4-1.8.1-fx.xpi">f1beta.com/macosx<em>theme</em>firefox_4-1.8.1-fx.xpi</a> </p>

<p>Note:- This plugin is work of <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/golf-at/" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/golf-at/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/golf-at/</a> and found online <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/macosx-theme-firefox-4/?src=api" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/macosx-theme-firefox-4/?src=api">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/macosx-theme-firefox-4/?src=api</a></p>
