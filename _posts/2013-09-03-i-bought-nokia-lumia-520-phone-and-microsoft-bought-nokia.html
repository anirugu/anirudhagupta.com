<p>I just bought Nokia Lumia 520 in last week and this week I hear that Microsoft Bought Nokia.   </p>

<p>Few months ago My asha 311 have some problem and stop working. I go to Service center and they refuse to fix my issue. I have no other option to do anything. In last day I bought a brand New Lumia 520 phone.</p>

<p>I just read the news “Microsoft bought Nokia” I don’t know what will happen to future of phone. Maybe Microsoft will put their own logo on phone which have print “Nokia” previously.</p>
