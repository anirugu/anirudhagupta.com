From 2010 I was having a blog at [old blog][old-blog]. Everything is going cool. Time by time I see a lot of issue on plateform. I see one day site goes down and it's never come back online.


From a long time I was writing at [old blog][old-blog]. Everything was going good. Time by time I see a lot of issue coming on site. The 
site goes down and never come back. So I moved here. Lots of thing I did regarding MVC3, MVC4,5, IE7 is no longer required. Firebug, Firebug Lite, Trackback, Pingback and lot of other things is become history. I have the backup of my blog, the html, images etc. I didn't use that because of those technologies doesn't make any sense today. Like in one post I write about IE10.
