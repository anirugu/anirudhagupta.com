<p>Do you want to run something when you open your system. Here is a simple way to do this in Windows 8.</p>

<p>press Win + R and type “%appData%” then press Enter</p>

<p>You are now in Roaming folder.</p>

<p>Follow this folder “Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup” in explorer.</p>

<p>Make a shortcut of apps you want to run and paste them on this folder. </p>

<p>This way you can run them automatically when you start your own system.</p>

<p>If you want to disable startup for any of executable you have set previously then you can use Task manager to disable them to no further run when you start your own PC. Look at the image below.</p>
