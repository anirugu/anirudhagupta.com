<p>Few years ago When I just start work in office I can hardly see smartphone anywhere. The person sit next to me spent 10,000 or 15,000 in 2010 to get a phone (which is not smart as today). that phone have hardly 1.3 MP camera and 3-4 inch screen. Yeah, Maybe that is touch ( I don’t have remembered those days very well) .</p>

<p>Those days are gone. Now Android phone is everywhere and people use phone day to day for many purpose.</p>

<p>So Responsive design is all about focus on Make good experience on Mobile &amp; tablet.</p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Go with a framework.</font></strong></p>

<p>Using framework like bootstrap solved a big trouble of responsive. Bootstrap’s provide solid foundation for making design work in mobile phones and other small devices. </p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Write our own custom CSS and other code that we can use in every project.</font></strong></p>

<p>After spent a lot of time on fixing basic thing I finally able to find some basic thing that I need to put on every project (html,CSS, JS) too. Like I do same for MySQL. Same settings to handle Unicode and other thing in every MySQL database.</p>

<p>This will save you a lot of time. Like Most of small work is about margin and padding. Making a class like .mt10 or .pb10 mt stand for Margin top and pb stand for padding bottom. this basic idea save a lot of time.</p>

<p><strong><font size="3">All design are same so make it simple and just copy the code and modify.</font></strong></p>

<p>When you write same thing again and again you will learn many things. For example You can figure out how one of your code is different from other. You can see the same code you write again is better then the one that you write last time. You are able to copy basic things from this to another one and it will save your time. This thing will not be easy if you don’t have a good practice of what are you doing.</p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Framework tricks &amp; perfection habit.</font></strong></p>

<p>Sometime we don’t have a control on project timeline. We need to do thing faster. You can simply complete the design. Sometime we have enough time for finish the work and later if you invest more time in it. Like you spent nights on fixing same thing that you complete in hours. You can learn many good thing which you found never able to learn when you do the work and just complete it.</p>

<p>Focusing on improving things will give you better image of how things can be improved. Like <strong>Prime minister of India</strong> do there work better then other and they have proved what is the difference between them and the other. Some people handle things well and other don’t.</p>

<p>If you complete the design and start new it will never gonna better anytime soon. What is need here is spent more and more time on perfecting things. You can show that someone who use same thing will figure out that this work is better than others.</p>

<p><strong><font size="3">FAST FAST FAST.</font></strong></p>

<p>when you have done enough of the work you can later produce thing faster then ever. Like old C# developer write code faster, same way you can write code better and faster.</p>

<p>Bye !</p>

<p>Happy Coding <img src="/2016_08_27_things_to_remember_when_Image1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
