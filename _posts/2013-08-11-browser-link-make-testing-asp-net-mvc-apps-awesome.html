<p>Few weeks ago <a href="http://madskristensen.net/">Mads</a> show us a cool demo of new feature in Visual studio 2013 (Express also). The one of the cool feature is Browser link. </p>

<p>Using this feature you can refresh the browser from Visual studio. Now you have open 3 browser for example , Chrome Firefox opera (maybe few more simulator). Now you can refresh all these browser without going to every browser and click refresh button. This is awesome feature.</p>

<p>This feature need Javascript to be enabled. </p>

<p>For more information watch the videos on Channel9.Msdn.com </p>
