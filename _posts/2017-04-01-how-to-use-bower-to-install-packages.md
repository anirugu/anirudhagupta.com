<p>In VS 2017, you have choice to install ui components by using bower. If you work previously in asp.net mvc project in visual studio you know all we use is nuget to install anything from jQuery to Newtonsoft.json.</p>

<p>For using bower right click on project and check manage bower package, this option list next to Manage Nuget Package.</p>

<p>Just like that nuget window everything is same. For library stuff you still need Nuget. </p>

<p><strong>So is there any way like in nuget I can just type and install the package</strong></p>

<p>The good thing with bower is it’s make a bower.json file in your project’s root directory. you can just edit it. for example I need to install moment.js in my dotnet core project now check how easily it is </p>

<p>open bower.js and start writing moment under dependencies. now when you go after : it will show you all the version. doesn’t it sound cool and much easier ?</p>

<p>You see a version number started from ~ and one is ^. you want to know what is that thing and how it’s work. please follow this stackoverflow question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19030170/what-is-the-bower-and-npm-version-syntax" title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19030170/what-is-the-bower-and-npm-version-syntax">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19030170/what-is-the-bower-and-npm-version-syntax</a></p>

<p>Thanks for reading my post, Happy coding <img src="/2017_04_01_how_to_use_bower_Image1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
