<p>One of my friend share his college experience with me. He is not related with computer science. One day he told me that <strong>Ankia Fadia</strong> come to their college. In front of many student he show how to hack BSNL website by tricks. he break the flow how BSNL site work. I have told them BSNL is one of the most unsecure website of India <img src="/2013_10_26_indian_government_department_have_Image1.png" alt="Sad smile" /></p>

<p>If you logged-in to website maybe it’s run in few seconds but sometime it run in 58 minute. OK this is not grammar mistake 58 minute is less then 1 hour. This means open a tab and put the link to open. it will open in hours.</p>

<p>If you are using IE8, Chrome and Firefox you will be forced to use IE7 or downgrade. I simply use Ie7 mode in IE for make it work. This happen because they use something that is called DynaTrace. </p>

<p>This site is most unsecure. now guess how !</p>

<p>Suppose my username is xyz and password is abc. How I can reset the password I simply go to website and in their site when I do reset my password he told me to fill password and password will not worked here.you can use here password here to reset my password. </p>

<p>Remember that username are different then broadband username and password. Suppose if I want to reset your password I simply need to know your broadband username and I can reset it myself. I just logged in with my username and when I open the page for reset password I can fill your bb username and password will work here. I have not tried this. </p>

<p>the broadband username can easily guess. this is depend on same way how people’s broandband username made.</p>

<p><strong>IS this Safe ?</strong></p>

<p>Nope, There are many thing on the site which make me feel that is 1900 century website. They still lived in popup life. These site are nothing but a crap. not work most of time and when work it’s run too slowly.</p>
