<p>Visual Studio have a nice integration of Extensions. Sometime when you want a feature you can easily got extensions (plugins) from Visual Studio gallery. Sometime some user have trouble the performance in VS when they got install too many plugins.</p>

<p>As in 2010 Visual studio not have functionality to remove all plugin component by one click. Like javascript extensions you need to remove every component of plugin one by one.</p>

<p>For removing all extensions in Visual studio manually You need to open Window explorer CTRL + E and type %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\Extensions. and press enter. This show you a folder which contain all plugins if you delete them then this will remove all plugins from your visual studio 10 installation. </p>

<p>Note:- This thing work fine on my computer. You need to remember then your Visual studio is sleep or not running when are delete the folder.</p>
