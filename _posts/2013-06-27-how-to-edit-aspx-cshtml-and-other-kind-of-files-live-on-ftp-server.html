<p>Many time we just want to make a small changes on site and we don’t want to download the whole project again. In this post I will show you some good way to do it.</p>

<p>People who have Expression Web 4 can do it. I tried it and it’s work good with aspx file. If you have site in asp.net and use aspx engine then this is a good option. Well, Expression Web is free (previously paid software).</p>

<p>A another good option is Komodo Edit. You can use komodo edit and few plugin to make FTP editing work for you.</p>

<p>The problem in these 2 apps are they don’t have syntax highlight and support for CSHTML file which are introduced with MVC 3. For this I suggest you to go with webmatrix. You can use Webmatrix to edit cshtml file online.</p>

<p>Remember that Webmatrix don’t support Compiling of MVC project. You need Visual Web developer Express at-least to compile your project.</p>

<p>if you are in hurry try <a href="https://c9.io/" title="https://c9.io/">https://c9.io/</a> put your FTP settings and you just got your hands ready to make changes on live site.</p>

<p>If you have anything else in your mind share it here. </p>
