<p>If you want to use typescript language in your Visual studio 13 and it doesn’t work for you then don’t be frustrated. There is no reason to wait for fix. </p>

<p>Now you can try these other way to compile your Typescript.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you wish you can use Sublime text. There is a package Called Typescript and Better Typescript. it’s gave you syntax highlight to compile. everything will be done instantly. </p></li>
<li><p>Another good thing is Microsoft webmatrix. If you are working on mvc project then open the same directory in webmatrix. webmatix will automatically compile your typescript files.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a feature in Webstorm and Phpstorm for typescript. You can compile your typescript in that tool also.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Typescript also can be compiled through NodeJs pacakages NPM.</p>
