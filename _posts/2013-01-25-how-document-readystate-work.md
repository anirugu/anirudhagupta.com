<p>in javascript we can use document.readyState to know the state of page.</p>

<p>Some state of page is </p>

<p>“loading” :- when page is still loading and script is executed.</p>

<p>“interactive” :- when page is finished parsing but still loading sub-resources.</p>

<p>“completed” :- page is completely loaded.</p>
