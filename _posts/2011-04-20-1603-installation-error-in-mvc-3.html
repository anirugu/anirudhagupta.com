<p>When user trying to install MVC 3 using <em>*Microsoft Web Platform Installer *</em>they got the message that MVC 3 and some other component also installed successfully but whenever in the condition you trying to open WPI again that they show you a option for adding all those component who you installed last time that means that they not installed successfully or error not occurred in WPI but actually occurred.</p>

<p><strong>So How i can install MVC 3 when i got error 1603 or whenever my system unable to run the setup or error occurred during the setup</strong></p>

<p>you need to run WPI again choose the option MVC 3 and click on install you see a new windows and Executable location on the server. get the setup by download them or download the setup through Microsoft official website.</p>

<p>When you trying to run the setup off course they never success but here is a trick to install MVC 3 indirectly.</p>

<p>when you run the setup they give you error that setup did not succeed. they show you a log open them in browser and found that they show you in bottom about 1603 error code who happened during MVC 3 installation. don’t close the setup just forget them.</p>

<p>Note:- if you close the setup all files located in your system temporary for install MVC3 gone so don’t stop setup.</p>

<p>when error occurred without closing setup go to C:\temp and you find many executable their. now you need to run those setup to install on your system.</p>

<p>those setup included</p>

<p>ASP.NET MVC 3 : required to working MVC 3 in your system</p>

<p>ASP.NET MVC 3 for Visual studio tool : optional for those who have Visual studio in their system</p>

<p>ASP.NET MVC 3 for VWD tool :- optional for those who have Visual Web Developer in their system</p>

<p>ASP.NET WEB PAGE : required to working ASP.NET WEB PAGE in your system</p>

<p>ASP.NET WEB PAGE for Visual studio tool : optional for those who have Visual studio in their system</p>

<p>ASP.NET WEB PAGE for VWD tool : optional for those who have Visual Web Developer in their system</p>

<p><em>*Note: *</em>their is no problem if you run optional executable perhaps in future when you install VWD you never need to install MVC 3 again.</p>

<p>during the installation never run the Visual studio or VWD tools because they never tell you to close as well as you find message whenever you running MVC3 Executable. remember a little thing more that don’t run a executable who have a word KB in their name because this is a setup who you actually run. if you run them they not running and give you same error who you got from Executable who we run firstly in this demonstration. if you run the setup they rollback Everything so be careful.</p>

<p>After that before closing the setup you we run firstly you can open Visual studio or VWD and found that’s now work. great now you can close the setup who give you message that “setup did not succeed ”. it’s really not succeed but now work in your system. </p>

<p>well i show you a method to install MVC 3 alternatively. this is work whenever their is no other option to install them.</p>
