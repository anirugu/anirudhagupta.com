<p>Every new version of Firefox Come with new features. Recently people using Firefox 21 Reported that Their Firefox has crashed after click on X-close button.</p>

<p>What is the problem ?</p>

<p>Actually Firefox have trouble with “hardware acceleration”. You need to disable it. Try to go to Tools > options > Browsing > uncheck the hardware acceleration. This is one of the problem in Firefox.</p>
