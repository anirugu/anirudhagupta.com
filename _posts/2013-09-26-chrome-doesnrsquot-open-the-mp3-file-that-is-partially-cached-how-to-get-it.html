<p>In your web-application if you are using mp3 file and on client side It’s partially cached and you want them to directly open them in browser it will not work. There is a little trick to get it worked.</p>

<p>Remember the query-string trick that is used for invalidate the cache in jQuery.</p>

<p>for example</p>

<p>if you don’t want to cache the stuff in browser then we use timestamp</p>

<p>example.com?time=1111211</p>

<p>Everytime time is new integer so this will never be cached.</p>

<p>Same thing can be used for mp3.</p>

<p>example.com/abc.mp3?test=121</p>

<p>Now Chrome will not download the cached the mp3 file. The benefit of using this trick is chrome will not take a long time to show the file that chrome already have partially cached.</p>
