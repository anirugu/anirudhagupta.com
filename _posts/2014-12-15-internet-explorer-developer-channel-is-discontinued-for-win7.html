<p>Less than six months ago I see a thing like Internet explorer 7 developer channel. It’s look like quite impressive for developer. Now Microsoft has killed it.</p>

<p>Now here is the update from Microsoft</p>

<p>“To continue previewing the latest <abbr>IE</abbr> web platform, join the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">Windows Insider Program</a> and install the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview">Windows 10 Technical Preview</a>. Once you join the Windows Insider Program, you’ll be subscribed to receive all the latest Windows 10 and IE preview builds as soon as they’re available or you can try <a href="https://remote.modern.ie/">RemoteIE</a> if you want to run IE from any platform.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/11/11/living-on-the-edge-our-next-step-in-interoperability.aspx">What’s new in the November 12th update</a>.</p>

<p>We look forward to <a href="http://devchannel.modern.ie/#feedback-page">your feedback</a>!”</p>

<p>If I move to Windows 10 Nobody will provide solution from Microsoft support team If anything goes wrong for me, They will say “We don’t provide support Alpha or developer build”.</p>

<p>So this is a nice way to force people to use something (even user not want to) or just killing product. </p>

<p>The developer channel is no longer work for me that I installed on my PC. When I open it “this developer channel build expire. Try to update to latest“.</p>

<p>I am attaching here image for a question arise from comment that remoteIE can work. I tried but it’s not worked for me.</p>
