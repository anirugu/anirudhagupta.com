<p>Many time we got the doc file which have some images. We need to try to extract them in Microsoft word which come with Windows 7 (not Microsoft office word). Looking to this article <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/itdojo/save-images-in-microsoft-word-documents-as-separate-files/135" title="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/itdojo/save-images-in-microsoft-word-documents-as-separate-files/135">http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/itdojo/save-images-in-microsoft-word-documents-as-separate-files/135</a> This article is only useful when you have Microsoft word installed.</p>

<p>Now if I don’t have Microsoft office then what ?</p>

<p>No problem, here is a trick. when you open the doc file in Word then select the image and right click on image and choose cut. open the Microsoft paint. paste them here. Without clicking anywhere click on crop icon on toolbar.</p>

<p>Now you got your image in the same size as you have in word file. Don’t worry about Image format. Microsoft paint have support for save them in PNG format.</p>
