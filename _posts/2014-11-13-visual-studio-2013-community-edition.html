<p>Few months ago I got my Visual studio express got running Web-essentials 2013 extension. I find it awesome for me since I do most of my work related to web-programming. </p>

<p>Now there is a good news from Microsoft that they have a new thing for us called “Community edition”.</p>

<p>The good thing in it is it is able to run extension that is same available to paid version like professional, premium and ultimate.</p>

<p>I didn’t have tried it so can’t say too much but look here <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2013-community-vs" title="http://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2013-community-vs">http://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2013-community-vs</a></p>

<p>it’s look too interesting. </p>

<p>Have a nice day,</p>
