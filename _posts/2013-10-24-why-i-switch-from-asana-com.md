<p>I used Asana.com from 1-2 years. have nice experience to use it. it’s not so easy. When I started using it it’s make many confusion. Now I switch from it. </p>

<p>When I first time see I really didn’t understand how to make a private list. There is a icon on top click on it and make it private. After doing that I still not sure if this is working. There is a lot of confusion made that time. I discuss too much to figure out small small things.</p>

<p>The UI is interesting but so hard to understand. What I am looking for is just a list that I can hold private. I would like to share it only if I put them shared and put email address of person to hold them same list.</p>

<p>Few days ago I see that My Win8 phone have a app that call Microsoft OneNote. The good thing of this MS app is that I can record my voice in the app. If someone want to make a list for future then he just need to say and this can be recorded. This is awesome when you feel that Mobile keypad is just not so fast as a normal regular keyboard.</p>

<p>Google docs are another good option to handle this thing. Just make a word file and use it. share it with friend with many option. One best thing is this app have very simply UI then any other apps.</p>

<p>One more alternative is <a href="https://trello.com" title="https://trello.com">https://trello.com</a> which you hear from joel on their blog <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/09/13.html" title="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/09/13.html">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/09/13.html</a></p>

<p>There are many html5 and browser based, mobile based app. Many of them support multi platform feature. this means you can have them from PC to your Pocket. One good thing we all wanted is offline. if you are not online thing will be saved and push back to server when you will be online.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with some apps are they are attractive easy but hard to learn. Their one feature are not clearly defined what he does. This make frustration and confusion to user. When app are not simple to use people start stop trying to learn it. </p>

<p>That’s all the problem I have with asana.com</p>

<p>If you don’t want to try anything then what about Sticky Notes that is part of Windows 7. This app are still usable since you can store the text on it. </p>

<p>If you know any good app to make a task list that provide access from tablet/mobile then put comment here. In the whole world of app there is a lot of app for doing this same thing differently. I mention few of them here. I hope this is nice to describe it.</p>

<p>Thanks for read my post. <img src="/2013_10_24_why_i_switch_from_Image1.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
